        when text is copied from a website or application. It is triggered when a user 
        copies a selection of text, whether it is via the browser's context menu or using 
        the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C on Mac).
        In React, the onCopy event can be used on any element 
        that can contain text, such as a div, span, or input element. 
        When the event is triggered, a function is called that can perform any necessary actions, 
        such as logging the copied text or displaying a message to the user.
        It's worth noting that the onCopy event can be used in combination with the 
        preventDefault method to prevent the default copy behavior. 
        This can be useful in situations where you want to customize 
        the copied text or prevent the user from copying certain content.",

        "onCut":"In React, the onCut event is used to handle the cut operation performed on a text element, 
        such as an input field or a text area. When the user selects and cuts some text, the onCut event 
        is triggered, and any associated event handler function is executed.To use onCut in React, you need 
        to add theevent listener to the target element. This can be done using JSX by defining a function 
        that handles the event and passing it as a prop to the element.In addition to logging messages,
         onCut event handlers can be used to update state, trigger API calls, or perform any other necessary actions. The event object passed to the event handler function contains information about the cut operation,
         such as the cut text and the target element.
        Overall, the onCut event is a useful tool in 
        React for handling cut operations on text elements
         and performing actions in response to those operations",
        "onPaste":"The onPaste event in React is used to handle events when text is pasted into a website or application.

        In React, the onPaste event can be used on any element that can contain text, such as a div, span, or 
        input element. When the event is triggered, a function is called that can perform any necessary actions, 
        such as validating the pasted text or modifying it in some way.
        It's worth noting that the onPaste event can also be used in combination with the 
        preventDefault method to prevent the default paste behavior. This can be useful in
         situations where you want to customize the pasted text or prevent the user from pasting
          certain content. However, you should be careful not to disable this feature entirely,

This can be done using JSX by 
        defining a function that handles the event and passing it as a prop to the element:When the user finishes composing complex characters, the handleCompositionEnd function will be called, and the message "Composition ended!" will be logged to the console.

It is a synthetic event that is triggered when the value of an input element changes.To use the onChange event in React, you first need to define a function that will be called when the event is triggered. This function should update the state of the component or do some other action based on the new value of the input element. Here is an example of using onChange with an input element:you must always use the setState function (or its equivalent, like useState) to update the state of a component. Directly modifying the state variable will not trigger a re-render of the component,

The main difference between the two is that onChange is only fired when the input value changes and loses focus, while onInput is fired continuously as the user types or inputs data into the input element. using onInput event can cause frequent re-renders which can impact performance. In some cases, you might want to use onChange instead of onInput to avoid excessive re-renders,
