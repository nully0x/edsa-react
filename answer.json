        "onCopy":"The onCopy event in React is used to handle events 
        when text is copied from a website or application. It is triggered when a user 
        copies a selection of text, whether it is via the browser's context menu or using 
        the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C on Mac).
        In React, the onCopy event can be used on any element 
        that can contain text, such as a div, span, or input element. 
        When the event is triggered, a function is called that can perform any necessary actions, 
        such as logging the copied text or displaying a message to the user.
        It's worth noting that the onCopy event can be used in combination with the 
        preventDefault method to prevent the default copy behavior. 
        This can be useful in situations where you want to customize 
        the copied text or prevent the user from copying certain content.",

        "onCut":"In React, the onCut event is used to handle the cut operation performed on a text element, 
        such as an input field or a text area. When the user selects and cuts some text, the onCut event 
        is triggered, and any associated event handler function is executed.To use onCut in React, you need 
        to add theevent listener to the target element. This can be done using JSX by defining a function 
        that handles the event and passing it as a prop to the element.In addition to logging messages,
         onCut event handlers can be used to update state, trigger API calls, or perform any other necessary actions. The event object passed to the event handler function contains information about the cut operation,
         such as the cut text and the target element.
        Overall, the onCut event is a useful tool in 
        React for handling cut operations on text elements
         and performing actions in response to those operations",
        "onPaste":"The onPaste event in React is used to handle events when text is pasted into a website or application.
         It is triggered when a user pastes a selection of text, 
        whether it is via the browser's context menu or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V (or Cmd+V on Mac).
        In React, the onPaste event can be used on any element that can contain text, such as a div, span, or 
        input element. When the event is triggered, a function is called that can perform any necessary actions, 
        such as validating the pasted text or modifying it in some way.
        It's worth noting that the onPaste event can also be used in combination with the 
        preventDefault method to prevent the default paste behavior. This can be useful in
         situations where you want to customize the pasted text or prevent the user from pasting
          certain content. However, you should be careful not to disable this feature entirely, 
          as it can be an important accessibility feature for users who cannot use a mouse or keyboard short
          cuts.",

        "onCompositionEnd":"In React, the onCompositionEnd event is used to handle the end of a composition operation, such as when the user has finished typing non-Latin characters or has completed composing a complex character with multiple keystrokes. When this event occurs, it is an indication that the user has finished composing the character sequence, and the component can update its state accordingly.To use onCompositionEnd in React, you need to add the event listener to the target element. This can be done using JSX by 
        defining a function that handles the event and passing it as a prop to the element:When the user finishes composing complex characters, the handleCompositionEnd function will be called, and the message "Composition ended!" will be logged to the console.
        The onCompositionEnd event is often used in conjunction with other events such as onCompositionStart and onInput. These events allow developers to handle composition events and update the state of the component accordingly.
        Overall, the onCompositionEnd event is an essential tool in React for handling complex character input and ensuring that the component updates its state correctly. By using this event, developers can provide a better user experience for non-Latin character input and ensure that the component behaves as expected.

When this event occurs, it is an indication that the user is in the middle of typing a complex sequence of characters, and the component should wait until the composition is finished before updating its state.
        To use onCompositionStart in React, you need to add the event listener to the target element. This can be done using JSX by defining a function that handles the event and passing it as a prop to the element.
        When the user starts composing complex characters, the handleCompositionStart function will be called, and the message "Composition started!" will be logged to the console.

        "onCompositionUpdate":"In React, the onCompositionUpdate event is used to handle updates during a composition operation, such as when the user is typing non-Latin characters or composing complex characters with multiple keystrokes. When this event occurs, it is an indication that the user is still in the middle of composing the character sequence, and the component should wait until the composition is finished before updating its state.
        When the user is in the middle of composing complex characters, the handleCompositionUpdate function will be called, and the message "Composition updated!" will be logged to the console.
        The onCompositionUpdate event is often used in conjunction with other events such as onCompositionStart and onCompositionEnd. These events allow developers to handle composition events and update the state of the component accordingly.
